# data-science-projects

This is my repo used to store my portfolio of mini data science projects. I decided to learn Python by applying it on real problems and datasets, thereby practising Python coding on real applications, learn skills in a variety of tools that are commonly used by the data science community (Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, GitHub etc.) and force myself to ask more questions.

As a complete amateur, my work won't be very polished and my coding will have a lot to improve on, but everyone has to start somewhere and this will be a good way to keep track of my progress!
